I have used ngrok for the api and networking and it is the free version so a small change you need to do:
1. cd tracks
2. ngrok http 3000
3. you get the link like this  "https://6c34ed73b643.ngrok-free.app".
4. Copy and paste it in the src/api/track.js and go to base url and paste it there in between "".
